# XKCD Random Comics Downloader

This is a simple script to download random XKCD comics and, if `kitten icat` is installed, display the comic in the terminal.

It saves the comic in your Pictures directory in a subfolder named `xkcd_strips`.

## Usage

```bash
./xkcd_random
```

## Installation

Just clone the repository and run the script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tcsenpai/xkcd_random.git
cd xkcd_random
./xkcd_random
```

## Details

This is a simple bash script (xkcd_random.sh) compiled with [bunster](https://github.com/yassinebenaid/bunster).

The resulting go source code is in `xkcd_random.go.src` and is generated by `bunster`.

It has been created for my own use, but I thought it might be useful for others, so I decided to share it. Also, it allowed me to have fun with `bunster`.
